# Add-on packages for vector class library

These packages are extensions to the C++ vector class library for specific applications:

* random. Generates random number vectors of integers or floating point values. Excellent randomness. Suitable for large simulations and multi-threaded applications.
* decimal. Conversion between integer vectors and comma-separated lists in human-readable form (decimal ASCII). Useful for reading and writing comma-separated files.
* vector3d. Three-dimensional vector arithmetics, operators, cross product and dot product.
* complex. Defines complex number vectors. Operators + - * / etc., and functions. Complex exponential function and logarithm.
* quaternion. Hyper-complex numbers
